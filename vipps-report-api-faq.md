## When will the API be available?

We can not give a date, month or any kind of ETA yet.

We are still quite early in the planning and design phase and will use the
draft documentation here to discuss with potential users of the API
and make sure we are developing the right solution.

## Which API keys give access to the API?

In short: The following API keys give access to the Report API:

* Using the merchant's own API keys for the sale unit.
* Using the partner's API keys, called
  [partner keys](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-partner/#partner-keys).
* Using the Accounting partners' API keys.

See
[Authenticating to the Report API](./vipps-report-api.md#authenticating-to-the-report-api)
for more details.
