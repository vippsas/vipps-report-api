# Postman

### Prerequisites

Review
[Vipps quick start guides](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-quick-start-guides.md)
for information about getting your test environment set up.

### Step 1: Get the Vipps Postman collection and environment

Save the following files to your computer:

* [Vipps Report API Postman collection](tools/vipps-report-api-postman-collection.json)
* [Vipps API Global Postman environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/master/tools/vipps-api-global-postman-environment.json)

### Step 2: Import the Vipps Postman files

1. In Postman, click *Import* in the upper-left corner.
1. In the dialog that opens, with *File* selected, click *Upload Files*.
1. Select the two files you have just downloaded and click *Import*.

### Step 3: Set up Postman environment

1. Click the down arrow, next to the "eye" icon in the top-right corner, and select the environment you have imported.
2. Click the "eye" icon and, in the dropdown window, click `Edit` in the top-right corner.
3. Fill in the `Current Value` for the following fields to get started. For the first three keys, go to *Vipps Portal* > *Utvikler* ->  *Test Keys*.
   * `client_id` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
   * `client_secret` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
   * `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` - Merchant subscription key.
   * `merchantSerialNumber` - Merchant id.

## Make API calls

For all of the following, you will start by sending request `Get Access Token`.
This provides you with access to the API.

The access token is valid for 1 hour in the test environment
and 24 hours in the production environment.
See the
[API reference](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/api/report)
for details about the calls.
