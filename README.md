# Vipps Report API

ðŸ’¥ DRAFT! Unfinished work in progress. API specification changes are still coming. ðŸ’¥

The report API gives you or a third-party acting on your behalf the ability to fetch information
about payments that have been processed by Vipps.

Review the [Getting Started](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md)
for general information about Vipps APIs: API keys, product activation,
contact information, contribution guidelines, etc.
