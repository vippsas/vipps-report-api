# API Usage

Before you can use this api, you will need to aquire a Authorization token. This field is named "Authorization" in the request-header and is used to identify your identity and permissions.

`TODO: Text about how to fetch the JWT`

When you have aquired the token, you can request information about your ledgers.
This is done with the [`GET:/ledgers`]() endpoint.

```http
GET https://api.vipps.no/reports/ledgers
Authorization: Bearer W_IfBcSr-askdjhsakjhdasdfgg
```

The response from this will include the ledgers you have access to, some meta-information about the ledger, and a list of relations that describes the accounts that this ledger is connected to.
