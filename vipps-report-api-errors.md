# Vipps Report API: Errors

Here are the Report API Errors with description.
See the
[Vipps Report API guide](vipps-report-api.md)
for all the details.

For more common Vipps questions, see:

* [Vipps API General FAQ](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/faqs)

## Error-codes

### Code: 10001
Unknown or undocumented error. This is a catch-all error that we in time want to reduce the frequency of as much as much possible. The reason of the error might be because of an ephemeral issue on our end and you should be able to retry the same query again.

### Code: 10002
Input validation error. One of your inputs did not get parsed properly or is missing. The message in the response should give you a better description about which field is required.
